# Overview
The Car Price Predictor project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on various features such as car name, company, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, and fuel type. This project leverages linear regression modeling techniques along with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing methods to build an accurate predictive model.

# Objectives
The main objectives of the project are as follows:

**Data Exploration**: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics and distributions of the dataset. Explore relationships between different features and the target variable (car prices) to identify patterns and potential correlations.
**Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding) to convert them into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
**Model Development**: Develop a linear regression model using the preprocessed data to predict car prices based on the provided features. Utilize techniques such as feature selection and regularization to improve model performance and generalization.
**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess how well it predicts car prices on unseen data. Compare the model's performance against baseline models and explore potential areas for improvement.
**Interpretation and Analysis**: Interpret the results of the trained model to understand the significance of different features in predicting car prices. Analyze model coefficients, feature importance, and potential biases to gain insights into the factors influencing car prices in the dataset.
